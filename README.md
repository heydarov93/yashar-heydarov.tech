# My Portfolio Website

**This project is still in development.**

## Brief overview
*This project will be my professional portfolio project. The main goal here is to build the project without framework - only with the vanilla JavaScript.
I just want to strengthen my fundamental JS knowledge and implement OOP and other features of JS.*
